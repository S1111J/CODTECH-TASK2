Overview of the Student Grade Management Project in Python

This Python project is a simple program designed to help students track their grades across different subjects. It calculates the average of the grades entered and determines the corresponding letter grade. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how the project works:

Key Features

Grade Input:
The program prompts the user to enter grades for five subjects: English, Maths, Science, Hindi, and Computer/IT.
For each subject, the user must input a grade between 0 and 100. The program checks to ensure that the input is valid (numeric and within the specified range).

Average Calculation:

Once all grades are entered, the program calculates the average using a function called calculate_average. This function sums all the grades and divides by the number of grades.

Letter Grade Determination:

Based on the calculated average, another function called get_letter_grade determines the letter grade:

A: 90 and above

B: 80 to 89

C: 70 to 79

D: 60 to 69

F: Below 60

Output:

The program displays the grades entered for each subject, the calculated average, and the corresponding letter grade.

Example Workflow

The user starts the program, which welcomes them to the Student Grade Tracker.
They are prompted to enter their grades for each subject one by one.
After entering all grades, the program calculates the average and determines the letter grade.
Finally, it prints out:
The grades for each subject.
The average grade (formatted to two decimal places).
The corresponding letter grade.

Conclusion

This student grade management project is a great way for beginners to practice Python programming. It covers important concepts such as functions, loops, conditionals, and user input handling in a practical context. Overall, it provides a useful tool for students to keep track of their academic performance in an interactive way.
